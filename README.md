# jimHouseHunt

To run the file that I coded, go into househunt-master/househunt and run jimHouseHunt.py.

It will currently return the Zestimate of a real Park Ridge listing on Zillow.

Listing is here: https://goo.gl/zUCBh3

The script needs this info from a real listing to work:
 - Street Address
 - Zip Code
