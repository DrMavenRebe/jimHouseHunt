# jimHouseHunt

To run the file that I coded, go into program files and run jimHouseHunt.py.

It will currently look for 100 2-bedroom homes in the Chicago area, get the estimates for monthly mortgage and monthly rental income, and return a list of only those that will generate >= $100 in monthly income. All of that stuff is editable in the script. Using a hard-coded property tax value right now as well.

Still more work to do on this front but works with hard-coded numbers for the time being.
